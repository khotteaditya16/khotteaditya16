### 💡 Who Am I?

I'm a data-driven engineer passionate about solving real-world problems through AI, machine learning, and intelligent systems. With hands-on experience in the automotive industry and a strong foundation in engineering, I thrive on transforming raw, messy data into meaningful, actionable insights. I consider myself an all-rounder — someone who can understand the technical depth of a problem, analyze it from different perspectives, and build scalable solutions. I enjoy the art of modeling, experimenting with algorithms, and making data tell stories that drive impact.
